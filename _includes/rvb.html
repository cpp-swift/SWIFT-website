                        What is RvB?
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Red vs. Blue (RvB) is SWIFT's semesterly cybersecurity competition which teaches skills in IT, 
                        system administration, business, and much more. In RvB, participants take the
                        seat of an incident response team responsible for defending a company's network of computers
                        against a real-time threat. This includes configuring firewalls, patching software, and
                        implementing other security measures. The goal of the competition is to provide participants
                        with practical experience in identifying
                        and defending against cyber threats, and to help improve incident response and incident
                        management skills.

                How to Play
            </h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Overview:</strong> There are two ways to earn points in RvB: keeping your servers operational
                and completing various
                business tasks from management. After sign-ups close, all teams will receive a briefing packet that
                includes important details about
                a fictional business and the network you are responsible for. The team with the most points at the end 
                wins!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Service Uptime:</strong> RvB mocks a real business. Keeping your business servers and the services they host
                up and operational is important. Your team earns points every few minutes for each service you keep functional. An automated
                scoring engine will automatically poll the core functionallity of each of your business-critical services. The scoring engine
                will have a scoring portal for you to view the status of your teams services.
                But be careful! If you accidentally cause a service to become unoperational or if the red team takes makes
                a service no longer fit for business, that service won't earn you points!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Injects:</strong> Your main business task is to keep your services operational. However, throughout the competition, 
                your team will receive additional business tasks, called <em>injects</em>. The business that hired you may ask you to complete
                technical tasks like setting up a new service, or ask for business documents like an inventory report of the network.
                Completing injects will reward you with lots of points, but make sure to do it before the deadline or no points for you.

                History of RvB
            </h1>
            <p>
                Originating from a partnership between SWIFT, CPP's CCDC/CPTC teams, and Troy High School,
                RvB has always been designed to be a learn-by-doing opportunity. SWIFT aims to expand this
                opportunity for SWIFT members and give the competition experience into everyone's hands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since its inception, past competitors, alumni, and other volunteers have joined the team to share their
                professional experiences with participants and continue to make RvB better.
